            <h1>The seven universal principles of the harmonious way</h1>

<h2>1</h2>

Darkness, distance and space are blessings from the mother. They are the wrapping on her gifts to us, which allow us to experience time and life itself.

<h2>2</h2>

All minds that perceive each other change each other, and all things that can be perceived are minds. All paths that you do not understand, you must walk until you do. A mind cannot die or be permanently lost, it can only temporarily forget or be temporarily concealed

<h2>3</h2>

The dreamer will always dream, and when she dreams, she dances, so the dreamer will always dance. Stillness is only a movement too slow for a given mind to perceive. Eternity is eternal motion. This is neither blessing or curse, in itself, it simply is.

<h2>4</h2>

Every consciousness is a child of the mother, and all children of the mother are equal. Created in her image, they are creators, dancers and dreamers. The mother is the child is the mother is the child. All things reflect the mother's own desire to be, to grow, and to bring forth fruit, and this is sacred, and this desire is intrinsic to them.

<h2>5</h2>

Dissonance resolves to harmony, and harmony generates new dissonance. Beats are separated in time, and time is punctuated by beats. All things have a rhythm, the heartbeat of the mother, the steps of her dance. All creatures in time are made of rhythm, and rhythm is all of their life. The first rhythm is the movement of sending out, which is creation, or projection (the path of the mother), and the movement of taking in, which is perception and absorption (the path of the child), and both take place always, weaving all things.

<h2>6</h2>

Good and evil, love and hate, aloneness and togetherness, dark and light, pleasure and pain, and all duality can only be seen by the child who is presently dreaming the dream of time and space. In the mind of the mother, all things are united in her music and her dance, and all things are her gifts to her children, who she loves as herself, which is what they are.

<h2>7</h2>

All things have their time, and it cannot be altered. What ends must end, what begins must begin. What dies, dies, and what is born is born. The child that thinks they delay or hasten the time is mistaken, for they themselves are part of the dance, and although they may conceal it from themselves, the impulse to change, to leave or to stay, is also within them.
